                    <h3>Inception of Mormonism (Drawing on 10-1, Textbook)</h3>

                    Mormonism came into existence following Joseph Smith’s claim that he had a holy
                    epiphany in which he was given a new gospel of the Bible and a command to found
                    a new church based around said gospel (10-1). Due to its rejection of common
                    Christian tradition, they were ostracized, persecuted, and eventually forced into
                    exile in the Western territories. A key example of this was the eventual murder of
                    Joseph Smith in Illinois (?) (Textbook).

                    <h3>Founding of Utah (Drawing on textbook, loc?)</h3>

                    Utah was settled by Mormon settlers led by Brigham Young in an attempt to escape
                    from the religious persecution that had plagued them in the East and Midwestern US,
                    leading to the founding of Salt Lake City. Mormonism’s position as the dominant
                    religion in this area led to later disputes with the East, especially concerning polygamy.

                    <h3>Mormon war (Textbook, loc?)</h3>

                    The Mormon War was a short-lived and bloodless conflict in which a body of soldiers
                    was sent to Utah and then quickly recalled with the purpose of outlawing polygamy
                    in the territory. This was resolved by its banning (without enforcement) in Utah.
